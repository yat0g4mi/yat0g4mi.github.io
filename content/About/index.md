Hello ! My name is yatogami (aka kozybear), my major is Cyber Security. I play CTF from August 2023 until now, and I’m a member of [Huntik team](https://ctftime.org/team/127635) and [TAS_DihydroMonoxide](https://ctftime.org/team/351063) team.

I’m a newbie and always want to learn about Cyber Security - specially is DFIR. Thanks for reading my blog. Hope you can find something helpful in here!!!
